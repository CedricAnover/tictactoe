If we want to create a AI to play tictactoe, we need to collect both the game instance metadata
and data for each game iteration in that game instance.

I successfully implemented a prototype, but it would be better to break the whole program into classes such as:

class Move
class Player

class Game
+ current_player: str
+ winner: str | None
+ game_iteration: int
+ move(row: int, col: int) -> str | None	// This method would invoke a method for collecting data.
collect_game_data()	// Collect game metadata and Data for each game iteration

class Board
+ board_size: int
+ board_all_fileld: bool
- grid: List[List[str]]
+ get_column() -> list
+ get_diagonal() -> list
+ print_grid() -> None

// In Board Class, we standardized the first move label to be "X", and then "O".
